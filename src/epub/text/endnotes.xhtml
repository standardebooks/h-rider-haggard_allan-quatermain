					<p>Among the Zulus a man assumes the ring, which is made of a species of black gum twisted in with the hair, and polished a brilliant black, when he has reached a certain dignity and age, or is the husband of a sufficient number of wives. Till he is in a position to wear a ring he is looked on as a boy, though he may be thirty-five years of age, or even more. <cite>—⁠<abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:personal-name">A.

					<p>There is another theory which might account for the origin of the Zu-Vendi which does not seem to have struck my friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Quatermain, and his companions, and that is, that they are descendants of the Phœnicians. The cradle of the Phœnician race is supposed to have been on the western shore of the Persian Gulf. Thence, as there is good evidence to show, they emigrated in two streams, one of which took possession of the shores of Palestine, while the other is supposed by savants to have emigrated down the coast of eastern Africa where, near Mozambique, signs and remains of their occupation of the country are not wanting. Indeed, it would have been very extraordinary if they did not, when leaving the Persian Gulf, make straight for the east coast, seeing that the northeast monsoon blows for six months in the year dead in that direction, while for the other six months it blows back again. And, by the way of illustrating the probability, I may add that to this day a very extensive trade is carried on between the Persian Gulf and Lamu and other east African ports as far south as Madagascar, which is of course the ancient Ebony Isle of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Arabian Nights</i>. <cite>—⁠Editor</cite> <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>There are twenty-two letters in the Phœnician alphabet (see Appendix, Maspero’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Histoire ancienne des peuples de l’Orient</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) Unfortunately <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Quatermain gives us no specimen of the Zu-Vendi writing, but what he here states seems to go a long way towards substantiating the theory advanced in the note on <abbr>p.</abbr> 139. <cite>—⁠Editor</cite> <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
